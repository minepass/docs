MinePass Policies
=================

The following polices govern usage of the MinePass website and software.
They may be updated at any time, with or without notification.

Terms of Service
----------------

A single MinePass account (as defined by an email address and password) may include multiple players linked to the
games supported by MinePass plugins.

MinePass **account** holders are required to be at least 18 years old, or operated with the consent/supervision of the player's
legal adult guardian. All MinePass **players** must be at least 13 years old.

The contented posted by worlds via the MinePass portal or within their game servers is user-generated content and
outside the control or responsibility of the MinePass platform. Any disputes that may arise between players and
worlds is exclusive of the MinePass staff and owners.

Although we hope it never happens, we do reserve the right to ban an account/player from MinePass for any reason,
including but not limited to illegal activity, hate speech, violence, or threats. A banned account/player may still be
“bypassed” by world owners (at their discretion) in order to continue playing on game servers protected by the
MinePass plugins.

Any suggestions submitted to MinePass or posted openly with regards to suggested enhancements, discovered bugs, or
more generally any idea to improve our service, is provided for free. Players may not claim ownership or compensation
for such suggestions if they are later implemented.

Financial contribution towards further development of the MinePass platform does not convey any additional rights
or benefits unless explicitly stated.
